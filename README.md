# Stata---Econ-345
Stata scripts demonstrating independent econometric work: data import, cleaning, log transforms, regressions, lag creation, dummy variables, and time-series diagnostics. Shows strong skills in macroeconomic modeling and analytical methods

Skills Demonstrated
Stata Programming Skills
Importing Excel files with import excel
Saving and re-loading datasets using save and use
Generating variables, log transformations, and conditional replacement
Creating extensive lag structures with tsset and L.# operators
Organizing analysis pipelines within .do scripts

Regression & Econometric Skills
Running OLS and robust regressions (reg …, robust)
Modeling economic indicators such as interest rates, inflation expectations, and unemployment
Using lagged dependent variables to account for persistence and dynamic effects
Creating interaction terms to test combined effects (e.g., inflation × unemployment)
Constructing and using dummy variables for recession periods

Time-Series Analysis
Declaring time-series data with tsset
Checking for autocorrelation using ac, wntestq, and Durbin–Watson
Implementing Prais–Winsten estimation to correct serial correlation
Using residual analysis to refine model specification
Building AR(1), AR(2), and extended lag structures

Analytical Competencies
Preparing and transforming macroeconomic data for modeling
Comparing log-linear vs. linear regression forms
Conducting diagnostic testing to validate model assumptions
Identifying structural patterns and recession dynamics
Applying independent, reproducible econometric workflows

Tools and Environment
Software: Stata
Methods: Econometrics, regression modeling, time-series analysis
Focus Areas: Forecasting logic, macroeconomic relationships, diagnostic validation

Summary
These Stata scripts showcase independently completed econometric analysis involving data cleaning, transformation, regression modeling, and time-series diagnostics. The work demonstrates strong proficiency in quantitative methods used in economics, finance, and analytical research roles.
